<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning up</h2><p>When you have finished with a namespace, please clean it up (i.e. remove it).</p>
<p>This helps to keep the cloud platform repositories well-organised, and speeds
up deployments and changes to the cluster (because the build process doesn&rsquo;t
have to spend time managing unnecessary resources). It also deletes the
associated AWS resources, and helps to keep our hosting costs down.</p>
<p>To delete a namespace and all its associated AWS resources, simply raise a
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests">PR</a> which deletes the associated folder from the <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments">cloud-platform-environments</a>.</p>
<p>So, if your namespace is called <code>mynamespace</code>, then you need to raise a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests">PR</a>
deleting the folder:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/mynamespace
</code></pre></div><p>&hellip;and all its contents, from the <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments">cloud-platform-environments</a>.</p>
<p>Merging this <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests">PR</a> will trigger an automated pipeline which will delete all of
your namespace&rsquo;s AWS resources, followed by the namespace itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NB: If you have set up a CI/CD pipeline, which deploys into your namespace,
then this should be deleted first, so that anything you delete later is not
immediately recreated by your build pipeline.</p>
</blockquote>
