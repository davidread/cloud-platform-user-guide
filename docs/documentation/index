<h1 id="cloud-platform-user-guide">Cloud platform user guide</h1><p>The Ministry of Justice cloud platform is a platform for hosting services
developed for the Ministry of Justice. The platform manages the infrastructure
that your application runs on and provides tooling for teams to deploy and
manage their applications on that infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="this-guide">This guide</h3><p>This guide is in the process of being reorganised into three main sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concepts - Background and overview of the Cloud Platform, and some of the important concepts underlying it.</li>
<li>Tasks - Tutorials and information to help you achieve specific outcomes.</li>
<li>Reference - Details and links to external resources providing more thorough information about particular topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>While content is being moved, all the existing content has been moved to a
temporary &ldquo;Archive&rdquo; section. We will be migrating content from there into the
new structure over the next few weeks.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-the-platform-for">Who is the platform for</h3><p>The platform is for teams working anywhere in the Ministry of Justice that need
to run software applications. To get started you need to be part of a team in
the Ministry of Justice GitHub organisation. Once you are, you can start to
deploy applications using the guides below.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-we-currently-support">What do we currently support</h3><p>Users can create non-production and production environments and get access to
