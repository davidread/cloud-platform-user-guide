<h3 id="ecr-lifecycle-policy">ECR Lifecycle Policy</h3><h4 id="overview">Overview</h4><p>ECR repositories created for use in the Cloud Platform will have a default lifecycle policy applied.</p>
<p>Due to some applications having a constant rate of images being pushed to their ECR repo, we found that the AWS limit of 1000 images was being hit by some teams.</p>
<p>After consulting with application teams, we decided to implement a lifecycle policy of <em>100 images</em> per ECR repo.</p>
<p>If you feel that you have a need to archive more than the last 100 images, please contact the Cloud Platform team, who can adjust or remove the lifecycle policy.</p>
