<h3 id="applying-a-maintenance-page">Applying a Maintenance Page</h3><h4 id="overview">Overview</h4><p>This document will serve as a guide on how to apply a default
maintenance page to your application on the Cloud Platform.</p>
<h4 id="deploying-the-page">Deploying the page</h4><p>A repository has been created to store all the files related to the
maintenance page:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-maintenance-page">cloud-platform-maintenance-page</a></p>
<p>The repository contains the manifest files needed to deploy a
standard maintenance page into your namespace. This directory also
contains the maintenance page HTML file, along with a DockerFile
to build an image to serve the maintenance page.</p>
<p>Within the <code>Kubectl_deploy</code> directory, there are 3 simple manifest
files that make up the deployment, <code>deploy.yaml</code>, <code>ingress.yaml</code>
and <code>service.yaml</code>.</p>
<p>To use this example, copy the files into your namespace and make
any changes you require, to tailor the maintenance page to your
service.</p>
<p>Once you have done this, the maintenance page will be deployed
into your namespace, ready for you to use as and when you need
it.</p>
<h5 id="maintenance-deploy-yaml">maintenance-deploy.yaml</h5><p>A notable part of this file is the <code>image</code> line, which points to
the ECR URI.</p>
<p>If you wish to customize the maintenance page, you must edit and
build the image and update the <code>image</code> value.</p>
<h5 id="maintenance-ingress-yaml">maintenance-ingress.yaml</h5><p>In this file, change the example <code>host</code> field to your applications
URL.</p>
<p>Rather than using this file, you may prefer to change your existing
<code>Ingress</code> so that the <code>backend</code> points to your maintenance page,
whenever you need to replace your service with the maintenance page.</p>
<p>This will ensure that you do not incur any downtime (by deleting
the previous ingress and creating a new one).</p>
