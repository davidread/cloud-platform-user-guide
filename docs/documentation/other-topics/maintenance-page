<h2 id="applying-a-maintenance-page">Applying a Maintenance Page</h2><h3 id="overview">Overview</h3><p>This document will serve as a guide on how to apply a default maintenance page to your application on the Cloud Platform.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-the-page">Deploying the page</h3><p>A repository has been created to store all the files related to the maintenance page: <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-maintenance-page">cloud-platform-maintenance-page</a></p>
<p>The repository contains the manifest files needed to deploy a standard maintenance page into your namespace. This directory also contains the maintenance page HTML file, along with a DockerFile to compile an image.</p>
<p>Within the <code>Kubectl_deploy</code> directory, there are 3 simple manifest files that make up the deployment, <code>deploy.yaml</code>, <code>ingress.yaml</code> and <code>service.yaml</code>.</p>
<p>You must remove your applications current ingress file from the namespace before applying this page.</p>
<h4 id="maintenance-deploy-yaml">maintenance-deploy.yaml</h4><p>A notable part of this file is the <code>image</code> line, which points to the ECR URI.</p>
<p>If you wish to customize the maintenance page, you must edit and build the image and update the <code>image</code> value.</p>
<h4 id="maintenance-ingress-yaml">maintenance-ingress.yaml</h4><p>In this file, change the example <code>host</code> field to your applications URL.</p>
