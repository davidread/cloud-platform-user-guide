# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Through the [cloud-platform-environments][env-repo] repository, you can provision AWS resources for your environments. This is done using terraform and more specifically, terraform modules the Cloud Platform team provides.

The documentation for the modules lives in each module's repository.

## Available modules

The updated list of terraform modules provided by the Cloud Platform team is available here: [Terraform Modules][tf-modules-list]

## Usage

In each terraform module repository, you will find a directory named `example` which includes sample configuration for use on the Cloud Platform.

In your namespace's path in the [cloud-platform-environments][env-repo] repository, cd to the `resources` directory and refer to the module's example to define your resources.

> Terraform configs for some AWS resources can be created using the [cloud-platform] CLI tool, e.g.
>
> ```
> cloud-platform environment rds create
> ```
>
> ...will create an `rds.tf` file in your resources directory.

Each example will have some global configuration defined, however, this should only be declared once, regardless of the number of modules used:

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
```

Additionally, some examples might define variables; again, these should only be declared once per namespace:

```
variable "cluster_name" {}

variable "cluster_state_bucket" {}
```

The main README file of each module repository will list all the available configuration options that can be passed to the module.

### Outputs

Each module will have its own outputs. These expose useful information, such as endpoints, credentials etc. The module examples all use a common approach: they employ the `kubernetes_secret` terraform resource to push the outputs straight into your namespace in the form of a `Secret` which you could then extract information from or directly reference in `Pods`.

This is currently the only supported way of accessing terraform outputs.

See [this article](/documentation/deploying-an-app/add-secrets-to-deployment.html#using-the-secret-in-your-applications) for instructions on how to use these secrets in your applications.

### Versioning

Only the latest version of a Cloud Platform terraform module may be used.

The Cloud Platform team will upgrade all existing instances of a module, whenever a new version is released, as per this [architecture decision record]

Please check the version badge for the module you are using (visit the web page of the module's github repository - the version badge will be just below the heading), and make sure you are using the latest version of the module in your configuration, by specifying the `ref` attribute in the query string of the source URL:

```
module "my_module" {
  source = "https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ecr-credentials?ref=1.0"
}
```

Refer to the [terraform documentation on modules][tf-modules-docs] for more information on usage.

### Monitoring AWS Resources

All resources are monitored by AWS CloudWatch by default. We use [CloudWatch Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter) to export a number of the metrics for the [Terraform Modules][tf-modules-list] we provide into Prometheus.

To view the current set of metrics available: 

* Log into [Prometheus]
* Click on 'insert metric at cursor'
* type 'aws_'

You can view all metrics AWS make available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html)
