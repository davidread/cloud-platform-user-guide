# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Cloud Platform provides read-only access to the AWS console to help you visualise resources and debug ancillary services (such as S3, RDS, etc.) without needing to use the [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

You can [login to the AWS console](https://justice-cloud-platform.eu.auth0.com/samlp/mQev56oEa7mrRCKAZRxSnDSoYt6Y7r5m?connection=github) to view your resources in `eu-west-2 (London)`.

## Prerequisites

### GitHub

To access the AWS console, you will need to:

- be part of the `ministryofjustice` GitHub organisation
- be part of the correct GitHub team(s) for your service

The [Connecting to the Cloud Platformâ€™s Kubernetes cluster](/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html) includes how to do this:

- [Joining the GitHub organisation](/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html#joining-the-github-organisation)
- [Joining the correct GitHub teams](/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html#joining-the-correct-github-teams)

### Tagging your resources

To be able to view your resources, you need to ensure they are tagged correctly.

You need to tag your resources with a `GithubTeam` key and appropriate value.

To do this:

- find the `resources` directory in your namespace in [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk)
- tag each resource you want to be visible with the `GithubTeam` key and your GitHub team slug as the value

For example, to tag a resource to allow the `hmpps-interventions` GitHub team to view it:

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "this" {
  ...

  tags = {
    GithubTeam = "hmpps-interventions"
  }
}
```

#### All namespace resources

To tag all of your resources, you can update the `provider "aws"` in `main.tf` to use default tags, instead of applying them singularly, like so:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  default_tags = {
    GithubTeam = "hmpps-interventions"
  }
}
```

## Login to the AWS console

After you've configured the prerequisites, you can [login to the AWS console](https://justice-cloud-platform.eu.auth0.com/samlp/mQev56oEa7mrRCKAZRxSnDSoYt6Y7r5m?connection=github).

Ensure you select the `eu-west-2 (London)` region otherwise you won't be able to view anything.

## Understanding the authentication workflow

The Auth0 application that authenticates you will add a `PrincipalTag` key storing all of the GitHub teams your user is a member of. This is stored as a simple colon (`:`) separated string, which is matched against a resource's `GithubTeam` `ResourceTag` to allow you to view it.

You can view the source-code for the implementation in the [cloud-platform-terraform-sso](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-aws-sso) repository.

## Caveats

### Cloud Platform

- Access to the AWS console has been designed, and will remain, as read-only. This is to ensure all of your resources are defined as infrastructure-as-code.

- Not all Cloud Platform Terraform modules currently support setting the `GithubTeam` tag.

- IAM policies for read-only access are currently a work in progress. We currently support:
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Relational Database Service (RDS)
  - Simple Notification Service (SNS)
  - Simple Queue Service (SQS)
  - Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

### AWS

- Not all AWS resources support attribute-based access control. You can find out which resources AWS supports by checking the "Authorization based on tags" column in [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html).
