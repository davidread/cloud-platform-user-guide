# <%= current_page.data.title %>

While all AWS resources are defined in terraform using the [cloud-platform-environments] repository, access solely via API may not be intuitive or complete (notable examples being logs, or RDS Performance Insights) so access via a web browser can be a better debugging tool.

**Note - access via the web console is and will remain by design read-only; our goal is to have 100% infrastructure-as-code.

## Getting started

Simply click this link: https://justice-cloud-platform.eu.auth0.com/samlp/mQev56oEa7mrRCKAZRxSnDSoYt6Y7r5m?connection=github

(the link itself should be permanent but is easy to regenerate, in such event we will update this page)

### Assumptions

We assume you will have:

* a Github login added to the [MoJ Organisation], with membership in any teams needed.
* all AWS resources tagged with `GithubTeam` - a string value matching the team slug in Github.

### Authentication workflow

The Auth0 app that logs you in will add to your AWS session `PrincipalTag` all the GH teams your user is a member of, as a simple `:` colon-separated string; this will be matched against the `ResourceTag`.

IAM policies are WIP, and feedback in #ask-cloud-platform is welcome! Only a few AWS resources have been added so far: IAM, RDS, S3, SNS, SQS, VPC; updates will bring in all those supported by our terraform modules (https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform#terraform-modules).

See the [SSO terraform module] for implementation details and supported resources.
