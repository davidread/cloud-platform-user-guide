You can share prototypes made with the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit] by publishing them on the web using an MoJ service called Cloud Platform.

## Before you start

To publish a prototype you'll need to:

* have github repository with Gov.UK Prototype Kit code.
* be a member of at least one GitHub team in the [MoJ GitHub Organisation]
* have the [Cloud Platform CLI] installed
* have a local development environment including a terminal and a git client

## 1. Copy (Clone) the `environments` repository

To create resources on the Cloud Platform, you need to raise a pull request
against the [cloud-platform-environments] repository.

Create a copy of the [cloud-platform-environments] repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments.git
$ cd cloud-platform-environments
```

## 2. Create your prototype kit site

In the Cloud Platform CLI run:

```bash
$ cloud-platform environment prototype create
```

You'll be asked to name your prototype/namespace, which should be the name of your prototype github repository.

This name will be used as:

* the [namespace] which will be created on the Cloud Platform
* the github repository name, to create files for building a docker image and a continuous deployment (CD) workflow, targeting the Cloud Platform.
* the domain name your prototype kit will be published to

> You must ensure that the namespace name should be the same as your prototype github repository and there is not already a namespace.

For example, if you choose `my-prototype` as the name, you will create:

* a namespace on the Cloud Platform called `my-prototype`

* these [template files][github-files] in your GitHub repository `https://github.com/ministryofjustice/my-prototype`

...and your prototype kit website will be available at the URL:

```
https://my-prototype.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

## 3. Raise a PR

After you have answered all the questions, the cloud-platform CLI will create
several files in a folder called:

```
namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/[name you chose]
```

Create a new branch, `git add` the new folder and then raise a pull request (PR).

Once a member of the Cloud Platform team has approved your PR, merge it.

When you merge the PR, the [Apply Pipeline](/documentation/other-topics/apply-pipeline.html)
will create your namespace and these [template files][github-files] in your GitHub repository. 

## Seeing your published prototype

There are a few things to be aware of, concerning your prototype kit site:

* It can take around 5 minutes for your prototype to be published

* The first time it tries to publish it will fail. Youâ€™ll need to publish a second time to complete the set-up.

> You don't have to do this - when you push changes to the repository, they
will be deployed successfully - but you may want to confirm that your site
works before making any changes.

* These [template files][github-files] created in the `main` branch. If you don't want any of these files in your git-hub repository or use your template files, edit the `github-repo.tf` file
in your namespace folder in the environments repository, as shown in this [example][github-example] 

> If you push any changes to these files in your repository, the [Apply Pipeline](/documentation/other-topics/apply-pipeline.html) will overwrite it shortly afterwards.
>
> The only way to update them is through environments repository, as shown in this [example][github-example] or remove it from the terraform
source code and copy those files in to your repository.

## Deleting your published prototype

When you no longer need your prototype to be published:

> Note - These steps are to decommission the hosting infrastructure that your prototype is running on. This will **not** delete your prototype source code.

1. raise a PR removing your namespace folder from the
`cloud-platform-environments` repository, and wait for it to be approved by a
member of the Cloud Platform team

2. **immediately before you merge the PR** use the GitHub web interface to
delete your repository

3. merge the PR

Your namespace will be removed from the Cloud Platform.
