### Overview

The Cloud Platform automatically collects and stores your application logs, and lets you access them via an AWS-Hosted [Kibana dashboard].

Logs are collected via [Fluentbit] and [Fluentd], and stored in an AWS-Hosted [ElasticSearch Cluster].

### Log Collection

Fluentbit/Fluentd is a cluster-wide log collection service.

The Fluentbit and Fluentd applications are configured with cluster-wide read permissions. As long as your application logs to `stdout`, your logs will be collected.

### Log Storage

The logs are shipped to an AWS-Hosted ElasticSearch cluster. All application logs are retained for 30 days.
