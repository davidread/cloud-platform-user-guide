# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The purpose of this section of the guide is to clarify what the Cloud Platform offers in terms of disaster recovery, the processes to initiate different types of recovery, and roles and responsabilities of the Cloud Platform and Service Teams.

## What does the Cloud Platform offer in terms of Disaster Recovery?

There are many scenarios in which the Cloud Platform could fail that would require some form of recovery process. We have tested and documented [runbooks](https://runbooks.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/disaster-recovery-scenarios.html#cloud-platform-disaster-recovery-scenarios) for each scenario identified. In summary we have plans for the following scenarios:

* Complete loss of the platform
* Loss of one or more individual namespaces
* Losing a Kubernetes Component or Object
* Deleted/corrupted the kops state
* Deleted terraform state
* Loss or corrupted etcd volumes
* Overwriting KOPS clusterâ€™s components with EKS components

In the case of all of the above the Cloud Platform Team is responsible for recovery.

*However, it possible that in the event of the loss of the platform or a namespace that we may require Service Teams to redeploy their services. It is also possible that any resources not added to your namespace folder in the [Environments Repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) (e.g. custom Prometheus rules) many require recovery by the Service Team.*  

The Cloud Platform Team is continually reviewing and identifiying risks to the Platform. As each threat is identified we are testing and creating recovery plans.

## What isn't covered by the Cloud Platforms?/Considerations for Service Teams

*
* Please ensure your `slack-channel` annotaion is kept up to date so that the Cloud Platform Team knows how best to contact your team.
* Please ensure you team is added to the #cloud-platform-update slack channel so that you can ensure you receive important messages for the Cloud Platform Team.

## Back-ups and restores

There are different types of back-ups made on the Cloud Platform for a variety of pursposes:

### Velero - Cluster backups

### AWS RDS Snapshots

### Other AWS Managed Resources

## How will you know if there is a Disaster in progress?

If there is a wider issues with the platform we will notifiy all users via #cloud-platform-update channel in line with our [operational processes](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#cloud-platform-update-slack-channel). You should check back here for periodic updates.

If we identify a specifiuc issue relating to a single service we will contact teams via the `slack-channel` annotation detailed in your namespace.

## How do I access these services if we have a problem or if we have any questions?

During normal [working hours](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#working-hours) please contact us over at #ask-cloud-platform slack channel.

In the event that this is a *critical incident* but outside of normal hours you can contact us via our [On-Call Process](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#our-on-call-process).
