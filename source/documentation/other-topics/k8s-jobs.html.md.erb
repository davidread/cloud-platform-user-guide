### Overview

Kubernetes has the concept of [jobs][kubernetes-jobs]. Kubernetes Jobs are created to run pods for a short period of time which are running for completion as opposed to different objects in Kubernetes like Replicasets, Replication Controllers, Demonesets, which is run continuously.

### Usage

You can use a Kubernetes Job to run batch processes, ETL jobs, sending emails, scanning database keys, etc. Follow the [guide][jobs-spec] on writing a job spec.

This example Job will start a busybox container that executes a bunch of shell commands.

Example:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job1
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: job
          image: busybox
          args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo sleeping....; sleep 90s; echo exiting...; date
      restartPolicy: Never
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
```

### Deploying a job to your Namespace

You need a yaml file to define your job. You can either create your own, or use above example.

      ```
      kubectl apply -f [file-name].yaml --namespace [your namespace]
      ```

Verify the job is created:

      ```
      kubectl get job --namespace [your namespace]
      ```

### Clean up finished jobs

When a Job completes Pods created by the Job are not deleted. Finished Jobs are usually no longer needed in the system. Use the [TTL mechanism][TTL-mechanism] for Jobs by settting `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`, so that a Job can be cleaned up automatically some time after it finishes.

We have [delete-completed-jobs][concourse-job] concourse pipleline setup to clean up all the completed jobs, which does not have `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`, deleting a completed Job will clean up the Pods it created. You can still see the logs of the deleted Pod in [kibana][kibana]

> Note: Kubernetes uses UTC exclusively. Make sure you take that into account when youâ€™re creating your schedule or setting up ttlSecondsAfterFinished.
