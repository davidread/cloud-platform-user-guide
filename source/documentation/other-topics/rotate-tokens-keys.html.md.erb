## Overview

Below is the guidance for rotating the tokens and keys that are set as environment variables for your application container or your automated deployment pipeline. 
This include only the variables fetched from system secrets from a namespace and not include any application related variables.

### Serviceaccount tokens
  Delete the secrets related to the serviceaccount credentials that are used in automated deployment pipeline like circleCI or github Actions. The secret name mostly start with `circleci-token-XXXX`

    ```bash
    $kubectl get secrets -n <yournamespace>
    circleci-token-XXXXX                                       kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      279d
    default-token-jgtdz                                        kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      279d
    es-snapshot-bucket                                         Opaque                                2      144d
    $
    $kubectl delete secret circleci-token-XXXXX -n <yournamespace>

  After the secret is deleted the replacement secret is generated immediately. Check the age of the newly generated secret to confirm. 
  
  Decode the secret using `cloud-platform decode-secret -n <yournamespace> -s circleci-token-XXXXX` to use it in your deployment pipeline.

### AWS credentials
   Contact `Cloud platform` team to rotate the credentials related to AWS resources such as ECR, RDS etc. The will run the instructions from the runbook [Rotate User AWS Credentials](https://runbooks.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/rotate-user-aws-credentials.html#rotate-user-aws-credentials)
