### Background

Cloud Platform ingress controller(s) are having performance issues due to the amount of ingresses
handled. We are encouraging teams to host their own controllers so we don't have a single
service managing all ingresses. 

Having your own ingress controller allows you to customise multiple load balancer components (error pages, HTTP errors, 
backends, etc). You are not able to do that by using the cloud-platform's controller.

### Pre-Requisites

This guide assumes you have an environment already created in `live-1` cluster and defined in the [cloud-platform-environments repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments)

### Considerations

- Ingress controller's pods won't be visible because they're running inside a cloud-platform's namespace where teams don't have access to.
- Ingress controller's deployment can only happen from [cloud-platform-environments repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments).

### Deploying

```hcl
module "ingress_controller" {
  source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-teams-ingress-controller?ref=0.0.2"

  namespace = "<your-namespace>"
}
```

### Using the new ingress-controller

By default, ingresses will always use cloud-platform's ingress controller
unless indicated otherwise. In order to use the controller deployed 
the following annotation must be added to your 
[ingress object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/):

```yaml
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: <your-namespace-name>
```

`kubernetes.io/ingress.class` specifies the controller name (which has the 
same namespace name) which is going to claim that ingress. If nothing is specified
it will use the default one ("nginx") which is the name hold by cloud-platform's controller.

#### Defining custom `values.yaml` for the nginx ingress controller chart

It might be the case that default values we provide won't fit your team's needs,
adding [custom `values.yaml`](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/nginx-ingress/values.yaml)
is possible using `custom_values` and `custom_values_content` variables:

```hcl
module "ingress_controller" {
  source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-teams-ingress-controller?ref=0.0.2"

  namespace             = "<your-namespace>"
  custom_values         = true
  custom_values_content = <<EOF
controller:
  replicaCount: 1

  ingressClass: mogaal-test:q
  electionID: ingress-controller-leader-mogaal-test
  scope:
    enabled: true
    namespace: test-mogaal
EOF
}
```

### Best practices

- [Do not share Nginx Ingress for multiple environments](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-ingress-controllers-how-to-choose-the-right-one-part-1-41d3554978d2), deploy a controller per namespace
- Try to stick with the default configuration provided so there is no need to maintain it and we'll keep it up to date for you.
