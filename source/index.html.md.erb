## Cloud Platform's offering

The Cloud Platform allows manages the infrastructure that your application runs on and
provides tooling for teams to deploy and manage their applications on that
infrastructure.

<!-- Topics
Made up of:
   * How-to guides
            For developers looking to do certain things with Cloud Platform.
            Is a series of steps.
   * Concept   
            For developers looking to understand Cloud Platform - it's main ideas & concepts, and how it works.
            Each concept doc will typically set the context for a How-to guide.
            Keep it simple and don't include implementation detail - this is for developers/users, not the CP team.
   * Information
            Not procedural, no steps
